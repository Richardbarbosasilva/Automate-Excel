# Automate-Excel
This VBA script has the power to automate any Excel formatation and convert files massively 

All you have to do is copy and paste the script inside the developer's guide on a excel sheet (for that, create a module), change the path inside the script to the folder you would like to automatize, and if you need to automatize many folders just replicate the 
script in another module, and before the "End Sub" on the script final's line, insert the command "Call X" where X is the other script name, it cannot be the same name as the first script.
